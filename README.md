# Speech-to-Speech Translation System
A beginner-friendly Speech-to-Speech Translation System built using Python, Google Colab, and open-source libraries. The system:
1. Takes **speech input** from an uploaded `.mp3` file,
2. Converts it to **text** using Google Speech Recognition,
3. Translates the text to the **target language** using Google Translate,
4. Synthesizes the **translated speech output** using gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech),
5. Plays the result directly in the notebook.
